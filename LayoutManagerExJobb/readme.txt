The work of Arvid Berg and Masod Jalalian is placed in a separate project until
we know what to do with it. The code must be fixed due to various reasons:

1) The domain classes do not implement Serializable or Remote

2) The GUI is experimental and not suited for end users

3) The same behaviour is implemted in more that one way because of the academic angle of the work

4) The layout manager from the Indian consulting firm is incorporated to some
extent and that code is certainly not confirming to the BlueBrim code standard.
