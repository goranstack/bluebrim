Graphics Operation supported by Postscript generation, used by the two-pass Postscript generation system.
Each class represent a drawing operation supported by the Paintable interface. These classes is used the following
way:
<ul>
	<li>CoPostscriptPaintable instantiates (basically) one new drawingop object for each paint method call, and
stores it in an array.</li>
	<li>CoPostscriptGenerator iterates through this array and generates Postscript code in a two-phase
generation.</li>
</ul>

The two-phase generation in CoPostscriptGenerator works as follows: First, for each object, the preparePostscript method is called. Then, for each object, the 
generatePostscript method is called. For most drawing operations, the preparePostscript method sets up the 
CoPostscriptHolder with information that is needed before actual Postscript drawing operations can be made,
such as font/resource list, Postscript procedure definitions, and similar. The generatePostscript phase 
generates actual Postscript code which, when executed at the printer, will draw a figure corresponding to the
CoPaintable method call that resulted in the drawingop object.
